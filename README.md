## Demo

### QuickCodePad

The `QuickCodePad` is a tool designed for writing and running code snippets swiftly. It opens a floating window, providing a convenient environment for coding and testing.

After closing the floating window, run `:QuickCodeRunner` to execute your code.

### Running Selected Code

The "QuickCodeRunner" feature allows you to select a code snippet and run it with ease. You can invoke this feature using the keyboard shortcut `<leader>cr`.

> [!NOTE]
> The global code block is always executed first, followed by the selected code.

## Limitations

Kindly be aware that quick-code-runner.nvim is presently configured to run only JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), Go and Python at this time. Although it might function with other languages, we can't assure full compatibility or offer assistance for problems encountered when employing languages other than JS, TS, Go and Python.

## Contributing

If you wish to support more languages, feel free to open a Pull Request. We appreciate any contributions to expand the capabilities of quick-code-runner.nvim.

Alternatively, if you need to run code in a language not currently supported by quick-code-runner.nvim, you may consider using [code_runner.nvim](https://github.com/CRAG666/code_runner.nvim).

## Credits

Drawing inspiration from the feature-rich [code_runner.nvim](https://github.com/CRAG666/code_runner.nvim), I aim to create a more simple and efficient alternative.
