## Installation

Add the following to your Neovim configuration to install `quick-code-runner.nvim`:

### Install with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    "jellydn/quick-code-runner.nvim",
    dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
    opts = {
      debug = true,
    },
    cmd = { "QuickCodeRunner", "QuickCodePad" },
    keys = {
      {
        "<leader>cr",
        ":QuickCodeRunner<CR>",
        desc = "Quick Code Runner",
        mode = "v",
      },
      {
        "<leader>cp",
        ":QuickCodePad<CR>",
        desc = "Quick Code Pad",
      },
    },
  }
```

## Configuration

Customize the plugin by modifying the default configuration. Example:

```lua
--- Default configuration for quick-code-runner.nvim
local default_config = {
  debug = false, -- Print debug information
  file_types = {
    javascript = { 'bun run' }, -- Run command for javascript, you can change to `node` or `deno`
    typescript = { 'bun run' }, -- Run command for typescript, you can change to `npx tsx run` or `deno`
    python = {
      'python3 -u', -- Run command for python
    },
    go = {
      "go run",
    },
  },
}
```

## Usage

- **QuickCodePad**: A tool for writing code snippets in a floating window.
- **QuickCodeRunner**: Run selected code snippets using `<leader>cr`.

### QuickCodePad

The `QuickCodePad` is a tool designed for writing and running code snippets swiftly. It opens a floating window, providing a convenient environment for coding and testing.

After closing the floating window, run `:QuickCodeRunner` to execute your code.

This feature is particularly useful when you need a quick, isolated environment for writing and testing code, which you can then run the code by press `Enter`:

### Running Selected Code

The `QuickCodeRunner` feature allows you to select a code snippet and run it with ease. You can invoke this feature using the keyboard shortcut `<leader>cr`.

> [!NOTE]
> The global code block is always executed first, followed by the selected code.

## Limitations

Currently optimized for JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Python. May work with other languages, but full compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Tips

- Run `:QuickCodeRunner` to execute the current file. Credits to [@al1-ce](https://github.com/jellydn/quick-code-runner.nvim/issues/33)
